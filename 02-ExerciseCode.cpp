#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1 = 8;

    int num2 = 10;

    int sum = num1 + num2;

    cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;

}
Firstly I declared num1 with 8
    Secondly I declared num2 with 10
    Afterwards I created sum as the addition of num1 and num2,the result is delivered by using cout output.
